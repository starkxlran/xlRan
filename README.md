The global litigation funding market exceeds USD 13.6 billion annually and continues to experience steady growth. One of the primary challenges within this industry is accurately predicting case outcomes in favor of the plaintiff. We are addressing this challenge by introducing xlRan, a platform developed on the efficient [StarkNet network](https://www.starknet.io/), enabling us to leverage public staking mechanisms and market dynamics. This approach empowers us to generate confidence scores and ranges for potential outcomes of specific cases while maintaining the confidentiality of each case.

# How xlRan Operates

All attorneys must first receive approval from a [DAO](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/) before they are permitted to stake their reputation on case outcomes. This is to ensure legitimacy and prevent individuals from creating duplicate accounts in the event their predictions are inaccurate.

### Membership Requirements

To join the Lawyer Approval DAO, members must stake a minimum number of xlRan tokens that represent their voting power within the platform. By doing so, members contribute to the decision-making process for approving attorneys.

As part of the attorney membership process, candidates are required to upload their credentials in advance. These credentials are reviewed by the DAO members to verify that the membership requirements are met and maintained. Voting power within the DAO is proportional to the amount of staked xlRan tokens.

Upon an attorney's approval, DAO members who have voted for that candidate will be entitled to a small fixed percentage of the attorney's earnings on the platform. This ensures that members are rewarded for their active participation and decision-making contributions.

### Uploading Cases

Once you have been approved as a lawyer, you can start uploading detailed case summaries and their locations. These summaries must contain enough information for predictions to be made, but please make sure to remove any personal details to ensure anonymity. Please note that uploading any personal details with the case summary will result in an immediate lifetime ban from the platform.

### Case Oracle

The status of each case is updated by the lawyer. This status is then voted on upon by the DAO. (Incomplete section, case oracle is still under design).

### Lawyer Reputation

The reputation of lawyers is intricately tied to their ability to correctly predict case outcomes. This reputation metric offers valuable insights into the track record and expertise of legal professionals, fostering transparency and accountability in the legal domain.

### Lawyer Cache Case

Lawyers can cache and predict potential case outcomes, offering a unique opportunity for investors to support packages of these cases. By funding these case packages, investors not only stand to reap the rewards of successful cases but also contribute to the growth and success of legal professionals.

Furthermore, a portion of the rewards generated from successful case outcomes is distributed to the lawyer, creating an incentivized ecosystem that fosters attorney-client collaboration. Performance records are maintained over the blockchain for each lawyer, providing a comprehensive overview of their track record, while the amount of reputation they can stake is carefully regulated to ensure a fair and equitable system.
