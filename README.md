The global litigation funding market exceeds USD 13.6 billion annually and continues to experience steady growth. One of the primary challenges within this industry is accurately predicting case outcomes in favor of the plaintiff. We are addressing this challenge by introducing xlRan, a platform developed on the efficient [StarkNet network](https://www.starknet.io/), enabling us to leverage public staking mechanisms and market dynamics. This approach empowers us to generate confidence scores and ranges for potential outcomes of specific cases while maintaining the confidentiality of each individual case.

# How xlRan Operates

All attorneys must first receive approval from a [DAO](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/) before they are permitted to stake their reputation on case outcomes. This is to ensure legitimacy and prevent individuals from creating duplicate accounts in the event their predictions are inaccurate.

### Membership Requirements

In order to join the Lawyer Approval DAO, members must stake a minimum number of tokens that represent their voting power within the platform. By doing so, members contribute to the decision-making process for approving attorneys.

### Earning Opportunities

Upon an attorney's approval, members who have staked tokens will be entitled to a fixed percentage of the attorney's earnings on the platform. This ensures that members are rewarded for their active participation and decision-making contributions.

### Uploading Credentials

As part of the membership process, candidates are required to upload their credentials in advance. These credentials are reviewed by the DAO to verify that the membership requirements are met and maintained.
